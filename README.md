# Jak Audio Tool

A tool that intends to handle the VAG directory of Jak and Daxter games.

I am still working on the basics, so contributions from strangers wouldn't make much sense, at least for now. Eventually it will be good enough for others to contribute.

### Todo:
- Figure out the VAGDIR.AYB format used in post-Jak II games. We don't know how it stores the audio names (this is kinda important), the rest are mostly figured out.
- Implement missing features, they are mentioned in the code.
- Improve code.

### Future plans:
- Make our own Sony ADPCM converter (to wav and from wav), or add an already existing one into this project.
- Maybe make a GUI.
