# Jak_VAGDIR_Tool

A command line application that can (will) handle the VAG directory of Jak and Daxter games.


### Todo:
- Figure out the VAGDIR.AYB format used in post-Jak II games. We don't know how it stores the audio names (this is kinda important), the rest are mostly figured out.
- Implement missing features, they are mentioned in the code.
- Improve code. Change existing code to be more object-oriented.

### Future plans:
- Make our own Sony ADPCM converter (to wav and from wav), or add an already existing one into this project.
- Maybe make a GUI.
